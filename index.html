						<blockquote>Let’s assume you reached a stage where you already went through the process of creating various business model prototypes for a business idea. Now, you've achieved the most basic level of business model generation. You've visualised your model by filling-out the building blocks of the canvas.</blockquote> 
						- <a href="http://www.marcelmuench.de/2013/05/option-cards-for-testing-business-models/">Marcel Muench</a>, an Option Cards user.
						<p>Most people start by filling in the blanks, and coming up with lots of ideas in each block.  At this stage, your canvas probably looks something like this:
						<img src="assets/images/Canvas_basic.v2.jpg">
						<p>This basic level is great for asking important questions, but doesn't highlight the most crucial dynamics.

						<blockquote>The real juice of business modelling is about discovering the dynamics of the models and the inter-relation between the building blocks.

										<p>Dr. Hilonga's water filter company started with small homes in rural villages.

If nobody could afford clean water, that would be a telling sign.

He scooped up the brown water, with insects and garbage floating in it, and put it through the filter. It came out clear and he drank it himself.
													<p>But only a few households could afford the filter, and most of the village people remained skeptical.  And it wasn't realistic to hire university professors as sales people to grow this business.

						<h2>Designing MVPs</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset1">
						<p>A key concept behind the definition of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is that it starts with a clear learning goal. The MVP is then designed around the question, <em>what's the minimum thing we have to build to learn this?</em>  
						<p>This clarity of purpose defines the "Minimum" part of MVP. The build work can be reduced to a minimum based on around the learning goal.
						<p>Without this clarity, it's common to add to or change the learning goal as you go, delaying the learning.  It's quite common in IT projects, and startups are no exception.  For example, most landing page tests start out with the question:

						<blockquote class="bm val cha rev">Is this value proposition strong enough that people will  buy this online?</blockquote>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<img src="assets/images/build-measure-learn.png">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset6">
						<p>But somewhere along the way, the founder sees there's value in collecting email addresses. So the landing page gets optimised for collecting email addresses of anyone even vaguely interested, not people who have shown strong commercial interest. 
						<p>The initial goal, to learn if people will click the buy button, gets lost. The landing page test ends up building a different business model dynamic.
						</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset1">
						<blockquote class="bm val cha rev">Is this value proposition strong enough that people will  buy this online?</blockquote>
					</div>
					<div class="span5">
						
						<blockquote class="bm res seg cha">Email list of possibly interested customers.</blockquote>
						</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset6">

						<p>Using Option Cards, you can see these are clearly different. What started off as validating the dynamic between revenue, value proposition and channel - will people buy this here? - ended up building a marketing resource for a different channel, email.
						<p>Use Option Cards to keep your MVP focused on the most valuable learning.

	    			<p>Effectuation is based on an academic study of how successful entrepreneurs think. It discovered a major difference between leading managers and entrepreneurs - while managers seek to understand before acting, causal logic, entrepreneurs understand that they can change world by acting, effectual logic.

	    			<p>Effectuation highlighted a few principles that you might find natural, but haven't considered explicitly:
	    			<p><strong>Bird in Hand Principle</strong> - Start with your means. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity. Start taking action, based on what you have readily available: who you are, what you know, and who you know.

					<p><strong>Affordable Loss Principle</strong> - Set affordable loss Evaluate opportunities based on whether the downside is acceptable, rather than on the attractiveness of the predicted upside.

					<p><strong>Lemonade Principle</strong> - Leverage contingencies Embrace surprises that arise from uncertain situations, remaining flexible rather than tethered to existing goals.

					<p><strong>Crazy-Quilt Principle</strong> - Form partnerships Form partnerships with people and organizations willing to make a real commitment to jointly creating the future--product, firm, market--with you. Don't worry so much about competitive analyses and strategic planning.

					<p>I'm the founder of Leancamp, a startup event for information sharing. Leancamp is scaling up now, and the experience is suffering from too many online tools cobbled together.

					<p>Failing to do so can lead to errors in observation, and design decisions that fail in spite of the appearance of evidence to support them.
					<p>Business Model Generation includes an often-overlooked aspect beyond the canvas, the Business Model Environment. This helps keep different types of assumption and tests clear, and with Option Cards, gives you a way of flagging up options that will only be relevant if your assumptions about trends, competitors or customer behaviour changes actually come to pass.
					<p>The business model environment also has <a href="http://www.saintsal.com/2012/10/how-investors-gauge-your-opportunity-beyond-your-business-model/">particular relevance to investors</a>, who are concerned with the growth of your target market, lock-in factors, competition and adoption trends.

					<h2>Other visual indexes</h2>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span10 offset1">
					<p>The core function of Option Cards is the visual index.  This allows you to quickly find the options that are relevant to you when you need them.

					<p>It's important to use an index that is easy to mark down, grows with your business, and is compatible with other tools so Option Cards can work seamlessly with them.

					<p>Rather than overcomplicating things or imposing process, Option Cards plays nicely with other approaches. I occasionally use my Customer Development symbols for example, jotting down hypotheses that have to do with jobs-to-be-done, goals,  decisions or emotional triggers. These lead nicely into tools like the Value Proposition Canvas, or approaches like the Customer Decision Journey and Disruptive Innovation, when they're useful.

					<p><img src="assets/images/custdevsymbols.png">

					<h3>The symbols flag what we'll need to retrieve later.</h3> 
					<p>When building our marketing channels, we'll need to review what customer interest and decision triggers we've encountered, and what customers currently try so we can align with their frame-of-mind. When we find we need to better communicate what we do, or what to zoom-in our product on specific needs, having a reference of customers' jobs-to-be-done is valuable.
