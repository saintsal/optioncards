						<blockquote>Let’s assume you reached a stage where you already went through the process of creating various business model prototypes for a business idea. Now, you've achieved the most basic level of business model generation. You've visualised your model by filling-out the building blocks of the canvas.</blockquote> 
						- <a href="http://www.marcelmuench.de/2013/05/option-cards-for-testing-business-models/">Marcel Muench</a>, an Option Cards user.
						<p>Most people start by filling in the blanks, and coming up with lots of ideas in each block.  At this stage, your canvas probably looks something like this:
						<img src="assets/images/Canvas_basic.v2.jpg">
						<p>This basic level is great for asking important questions, but doesn't highlight the most crucial dynamics.

						<blockquote>The real juice of business modelling is about discovering the dynamics of the models and the inter-relation between the building blocks.

										<p>So Jordan, the founder, texted a free beer coupon to each of his friends.

										<p>To learn these quickly, Jordan went to the local pub, put £200 behind the bar and said, "if anyone asks for a drink and mentions Gift Cannon, put it on this tab." He had his friends send their friends some drinks over Facebook, and he observed what they did when they came in. 
										<p>He was looking to see if there was any value in those new customers to the pub. Turns out most stayed for a few more drinks.

										<p>We can see something important in the Gift Cannon story - learning was fast.  It was fast because they could stay focused on their learning goals, validating one specific business model dynamic at a time.

						<h2>Designing MVPs</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset1">
						<p>A key concept behind the definition of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is that it starts with a clear learning goal. The MVP is then designed around the question, <em>what's the minimum thing we have to build to learn this?</em>  
						<p>This clarity of purpose defines the "Minimum" part of MVP. The build work can be reduced to a minimum based on around the learning goal.
						<p>Without this clarity, it's common to add to or change the learning goal as you go, delaying the learning.  It's quite common in IT projects, and startups are no exception.  For example, most landing page tests start out with the question:

						<blockquote class="bm val cha rev">Is this value propoisition strong enough that people will  buy this online?</blockquote>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<img src="assets/images/build-measure-learn.png">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset6">
						<p>But somewhere along the way, the founder sees there's value in collecting email addresses. So the landing page gets optimised for collecting email addresses of anyone even vaguely interested, not people who have shown strong commercial interest. 
						<p>The initial goal, to learn if people will click the buy button, gets lost. The landing page test ends up building a different business model dynamic.
						</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset1">
						<blockquote class="bm val cha rev">Is this value propoisition strong enough that people will  buy this online?</blockquote>
					</div>
					<div class="span5">
						
						<blockquote class="bm res seg cha">Email list of possibly interested customers.</blockquote>
						</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="span5 offset6">

						<p>Using Option Cards, you can see these are clearly different. What started off as validating the dynamic between revenue, value proposition and channel - will people buy this here? - ended up building a marketing resource for a different channel, email.
						<p>Use Option Cards to keep your MVP focused on the most valuable learning.

	    			<h2>Effectuation </h2>
	    			<p>Effectuation is based on an academic study of how successful entrepreneurs think. It discovered a major difference between leading managers and entrepreneurs - while managers seek to understand before acting, causal logic, entrepreneurs understand that they can change world by acting, effectual logic.

	    			<p>Effectuation highlighted a few principles that you might find natural, but haven't considered explicitly:
	    			<p><strong>Bird in Hand Principle</strong> - Start with your means. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity. Start taking action, based on what you have readily available: who you are, what you know, and who you know.

					<p><strong>Affordable Loss Principle</strong> - Set affordable loss Evaluate opportunities based on whether the downside is acceptable, rather than on the attractiveness of the predicted upside.

					<p><strong>Lemonade Principle</strong> - Leverage contingencies Embrace surprises that arise from uncertain situations, remaining flexible rather than tethered to existing goals.

					<p><strong>Crazy-Quilt Principle</strong> - Form partnerships Form partnerships with people and organizations willing to make a real commitment to jointly creating the future--product, firm, market--with you. Don't worry so much about competitive analysesand strategic planning.

					<p>I'm the founder of Leancamp, a startup event for information sharing. Leancamp is scaling up now, and the experience is suffering from too many online tools cobbled together. Leancamp partipants have to log in to 3 or 4 separate websites to get the most out of the event. I carved out a week consoidate and replace all of our external tools with a single Wordpress site, but was unsuccessful at the complicated implimentation.  

					<p>I was spinning my wheels on what I thought was technical problems.

					<p>By mapping out how each feature impacted a core Leancamp business model dynamic, I was able to spot a ton a features that didn't move the needle because they weren't affecting the core Leancamp model meaningfully.

				<div class="span4">

					<p>I could then ask clear questions about how each would improve the Leancamp business model, and turns out most features had better, simpler, non-technical alternatives.

				<div class="span4">
					<img src="assets/images/leancamp-final.png">
					<p> The remaining features were simpler to build from scratch, allowing me to drop the complications Wordpress entails. The answer was a paper-based prototype I would run at the next Leancamp event, which once successful, would be built quickly using a modern tech stack.

					<p>Option Cards were designed to rapidly scaffold a working business model for time-strapped, early-stage startups - but I've learned they're useful when scaling too.  Option Cards was picked up by BackupAgent, who just raised $2M. 
					<p>They explained that with this level of investment behind them, a ton of new options are presenting themselves. Where before they had to hustle hard to make connections, all the big players are offering partnerships with them . They're under considerable pressure to manage these options, and choose the best among them, which is where Option Cards helps.

					<h2>The Business Model Environment</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span5 offset1">
					<p>In business model design, it's important to clearly differentiate between what's within your control and what isn't. 
					
					</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="span5 offset1">	
					<p>Failing to do so can lead to errors in observation, and design decisions that fail in spite of the appearance of evidence to support them.
					<p>Business Model Generation includes an often-overlooked aspect beyond the canvas, the Business Model Environment. This helps keep different types of assumption and tests clear, and with Option Cards, gives you a way of flagging up options that will only be relevant if your assumptions about trends, competitors or customer behaviour changes actually come to pass.
					<p>The business model envoronment also has <a href="http://www.saintsal.com/2012/10/how-investors-gauge-your-opportunity-beyond-your-business-model/">particular relevance to investors</a>, who are concerned with the growth of your target market, lock-in factors, competition and adoption trends.

				<div class="span12">
					<h2>Other visual indexes</h2>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span10 offset1">
					<p>The core function of Option Cards is the visual index.  This allows you to quickly find the options that are relevant to you when you need them.

					<p>It's important to use an index that is easy to mark down, grows with your business, and is compatible with other tools so Option Cards can work seamlessly with them.

					<p>Rather than overcomplicating things or imposing process, Option Cards plays nicely with other approaches. I occassionally use my Customer Development symbols for example, jotting down hypotheses that have to do with jobs-to-be-done, goals,  decisions or emotional triggers. These lead nicely into tools like the Value Propositon Canvas, or approaches like the Customer Decision Journey and Disruptive Innovation, when they're useful.

					<p><img src="assets/images/custdevsymbols.png">

					<h3>The symbols flag what we'll need to retreive later.</h3> 
					<p>When building our marketing channels, we'll need to review what customer interest and decision triggers we've encountered, and what customers currently try so we can align with their frame-of-mind. When we find we need to better communicate what we do, or what to zoom-in our product on specific needs, having a reference of customers' jobs-to-be-done is valuable.
